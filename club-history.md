## Club History
The “Early Days” notes were found in some old sponsor proposal documents and the last decade description was compiled by members of the current committee. Obviously there are huge gaps in this brief history that deserve to be recorded and shared with the City faithful, so if you can help “fill in the gaps” or correct any inaccuracies please send your notes via email to info@stkildacity.com
 
## The Early Days
The Club originated in 1946 as the Inkerman Rovers playing social football. In 1951 the Club moved to Alma Road Park, St Kilda, and changed its name to Balaclava.

When the Peanut Farm Reserve became available in 1952 the Club relocated and with the demise of the VFA subdistrict competition joined the metropolitan league.

In 1958, the Club became affiliated with the St Kilda Football Club wearing St Kilda colours which it has continued to this day. This affiliation however ceased when the St Kilda Football Club moved to Moorabbin.

St Kilda City joined the South Eastern Suburban Football League in 1964 and in 1978 became St Kilda City Sports Club with the introduction of cricket for interested members.

In 1981 the new pavilion was built on the current site with a government grant from Youth Sports and Recreation and on the 13th of December was officially opened by his worship the Mayor of St Kilda Councillor Colin Bell JP in the presence of the honourable Brian Dixon MP and member for St Kilda Brian Williams.

The re-introduction of Colts (under eighteen) football to the Southern Football League in 2008 has been met with open arms by the St Kilda City Football Club. The City Colts have now won 5 premierships and provided a wealth of talented footballers to the senior and reserves sides with some also making their mark in VFL ranks.
